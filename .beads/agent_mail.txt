[2026-01-09T07:01:00-05:00] From: opus-cpal | Subject: Starting custom pattern allowlisting for heredoc scanning

Taking over git_safety_guard-cpal (custom pattern allowlisting for heredoc scanning).

Build is now passing after my previous fixes to evaluator.rs. The hcfg dependency is closed, so cpal is unblocked.

Will implement:
- AllowlistConfig struct with commands, patterns, content_hashes, projects
- Per-language pattern matching for heredocs
- Integration with existing heredoc scanning pipeline

ETA: This session.
