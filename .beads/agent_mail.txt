[2026-01-09T07:25:00-05:00] From: opus-cpal | Subject: Completed heredoc content allowlist integration

git_safety_guard-cpal is now closed.

Implementation complete:
- Added command-level allowlist check in evaluate_heredoc (before extraction)
- Added content-level allowlist check in evaluate_heredoc (before AST matching)
- Both checks use existing HeredocAllowlistConfig methods from config.rs:
  - is_command_allowlisted(command) -> checks if command prefix is whitelisted
  - is_content_allowlisted(content, language, project_path) -> checks patterns/hashes

Commit: b44e86c

All 646 tests pass. The config structs were already in config.rs with full unit tests - this work just wired them into the evaluation pipeline.

Users can now configure heredoc allowlists in config.toml under [heredoc.allowlist].
